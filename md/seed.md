# How to Template

## Introduction

Below you'll find a basic markup and special html formatting options available in this How To Template.

# 1: Standard Markdown markup

	# Header 1
	## Header 2
	### Header 3

	Paragraph of text .... Lorem ipsum.

**For full documentation check: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/**

Result (below)

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

Paragraph of text .... Lorem ipsum.


# 2: Media 

**General note: Store all media files in the lib-folder to keep a nice and clean repository**

## Images and Gifs
You add these also using the standard Markdown markup:

	![](./lib/YOURFILE.ext(png/jpg/gif..))

Result (below or to the right):

![](./lib/placeholder.png)

## Videos
You'll have to add videos using the html-video-tag. Also you'll have to supply two file versions video: one formatted as mp4, the other formatted as ogv. To convert a video you can use FFMPEG or a gui-interface such as miro video-converter (http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/). This is the markup. It's best not to split the tag into several lines, since this can confuse Pandoc:

	<video poster="./html/background.png"><source src="./lib/YOURFILE.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="./lib/YOURFILE.ogv" type="video/ogg"></video>
	
Result (below):

<video poster="./html/background.png"><source src="./lib/placeholder.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="./lib/placeholder.ogv" type="video/ogg"></video>

# 3: Special html options made for this template

**A mix-in between html and markdown is possible. Therefore certain html-wrappers have been added to give structure to the how to.**

## Header options:

The header of the how to is automatically generated by javascript. It supplys a menu with 'chapters' each item based on the '# Header 1'-titles.  Also it offers you to give the how-to a title. This is done by placing this custom piece of html anywhere in your markdown-file. It looks like this:

	<div class="pagetitle">Your How To Title</div>

Result (see the title 'Your How To Title' in the header)

<div class="pagetitle">Your How To Title</div>


## Infoboxes:

	<div class="infobox">

	### For 'infoboxes' that stands out from the main text.

	**Author:** Template

	</div>

Result (below or to the right):

<div class="infobox">

### For 'infoboxes' that stands out from the main text.

**Author:** Template

</div>

## Linkboxes

	<div class="linkbox">

	### For all Your Links/ Resourcers

	**Author:** Template

	</div>

Result (below or to the right):

<div class="linkbox">

### For all Your Links/ Resourcers

**Author:** Template

</div>

## Difficulty levels:

Small wrappers to indicate difficulty level. The single div will automatically have a set text relating to the level (easy, moderate, expert), but you can supply more info in the div it self.

	<div class="difficulty-level easy"></div>
	<div class="difficulty-level moderate"></div>
	<div class="difficulty-level expert"></div>

	And expanded:

	<div class="difficulty-level easy">This difficulty level is </div>

Result:

<div class="difficulty-level easy"></div>
<div class="difficulty-level moderate"></div>
<div class="difficulty-level expert"></div>

<div class="difficulty-level easy">This difficulty level is </div>
