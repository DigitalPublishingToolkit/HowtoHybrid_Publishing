# Test markdown document

# This is a H1 Header
## This is a H2 Sub-header
### This is a H3 Paragraph header

Headers are created using the pound symbol (\#). A single # will create a header 1 (H1), 2 ## will create a header 2 (H2) and so on until H6. 

This is a paragraph in markdown, it is simply text. Unlike html it has no tags like \<p> to show it is a paragraph. By adding * characters I can make this word *italic* and this **bold**.
Markdown is a simple language that is easily converted to different outputs, which is why we use it in the hybrid publishing workflow.

Footnotes look like this: \[^fn-sample_footnote]
